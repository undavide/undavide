- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @undavide, a software developer from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a Photoshop plugin developer with JavaScript, TypeScript and React. I've authored a few books and courses on the subject. By trade I'm a 20+ years Photoshop retoucher.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my next Photoshop book (hopefully to be published in Q4/2023)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [my blog](https://www.davidebarranca.com) (remember blogs?), [my books/courses website](https://www.ps-scripting.com), [my plugins website](https://www.cc-extensions.com). I'm `@undavide` on Twitter too, as long as that boat floats.
